Hannah Folk Burger App
=======

## Description

This is my burger application, created using node.js, express, express-handlebars, and mysql.

## Process

I began by setting up the app with the config, controllers, db, models, views folders, and all the files that are inside them. Next I started working on the individual connection.js, orm.js, burgers_controller.js, schema.sql, seeds.sql, and burger.js and connecting them all. Then I worked on the handlebars and making sure the layouts looked like how I wanted them to look. After that, I broke down the different functionalities of the controllers and seeing if they would work with the handlebars files.
